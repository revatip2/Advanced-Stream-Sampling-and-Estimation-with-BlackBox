## Introduction

Stream sampling and estimation are fundamental tasks in data analysis, particularly in scenarios where data streams are continuously generated and need to be analyzed in real-time or in batches. These techniques allow for efficient processing of streaming data, providing approximate results with controlled error rates.

## Approach A: Count-Min Sketch

### Purpose
Approach A implements the Count-Min Sketch algorithm for estimating the frequency of elements in a stream. This algorithm is highly efficient in terms of both memory and computational requirements, making it suitable for processing large data streams.

```python a.py <input_file_path> <stream_size> <num_asks> <output_filename>```
- `<input_file_path>`: Path to the input dataset file.
- `<stream_size>`: Size of the stream to process.
- `<num_asks>`: Number of iterations or asks to perform.
- `<output_filename>`: Path to store the output results.

### Implementation Details
- The script initializes a Count-Min Sketch data structure with a specified width and depth.
- It processes the stream of elements, updating the sketch to estimate the frequency of each element.
- The results are written to an output file, providing approximate frequency estimates for the stream elements.

## Approach B: HyperLogLog

### Purpose
Approach B utilizes the HyperLogLog algorithm for estimating the distinct count of elements in a stream. This algorithm provides accurate estimates of the cardinality of large data streams using limited memory resources.

```python b.py <input_file_path> <stream_size> <num_asks> <output_filename>```

- `<input_file_path>`: Path to the input dataset file.
- `<stream_size>`: Size of the stream to process.
- `<num_asks>`: Number of iterations or asks to perform.
- `<output_filename>`: Path to store the output results.

### Implementation Details
- The script initializes a HyperLogLog data structure with a specified precision parameter.
- It processes the stream of elements, updating the data structure to estimate the distinct count.
- The results are written to an output file, providing approximate cardinality estimates for the stream.

## Approach C: Reservoir Sampling

### Purpose
Approach C implements reservoir sampling for selecting a random sample from a stream. This technique allows for unbiased selection of samples from large or infinite streams, without needing to store the entire stream in memory.

### Usage
1. Ensure the BlackBox library is installed and configured.
2. Run the script with the following command-line arguments:

```python c.py <input_file_path> <stream_size> <num_asks> <output_filename>```

- `<input_file_path>`: Path to the input dataset file.
- `<stream_size>`: Size of the stream to process.
- `<num_asks>`: Number of iterations or asks to perform.
- `<output_filename>`: Path to store the output results.

### Implementation Details
- The script initializes a reservoir with a specified size to hold the sampled elements.
- It processes the stream of elements, updating the reservoir using the reservoir sampling algorithm.
- The sampled elements are written to an output file, providing a representative sample of the stream.

## Conclusion

Stream sampling and estimation techniques are essential for efficiently processing large-scale data streams and extracting valuable insights. By leveraging algorithms like Count-Min Sketch, HyperLogLog, and reservoir sampling, researchers and practitioners can analyze streaming data in real-time or in batches, enabling various downstream analyses and applications.
